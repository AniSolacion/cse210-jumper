# cse210-jumper
Implementing a version of hangman called jumper. The player guesses
a letter in a randomly chosen word. If the letter is part of the word
then that letter will be inserted as many times as it occurs. If not in 
the word, a part of the parachute is lost. If all parts of the parachute
are gone, then the user loses. If the word is guessed before the parachute 
is gone, the user wins.
